Description: The final project on the subject of Web Technologies of the first semester of 2020, consisting in a site with map content and a search engine that is able to find various addressees. Written in js library called react.js

Feedbacks:
Aisuluu Arstanbaeva:
"The site works quite well, it would be possible to add some updates such as other types of maps or an archive where previous requests would be saved."

Dastan Asanov:
"The site is convenient to use, the code is written simply and clearly. 
If you want to change something in the interface, you can do it easily, since all the necessary codes are easy to find."

Tilek Karaev:
"I liked that on the site you can find different locations, not just streets or cities, but also continents. 
In the code, everything is also clear and clean, although for me I would add more different icons to cities and streets."

Pamirbek Almazbekov:
"I drew attention to the design of the site and the selected colors, all in moderate tones, which allows the user to use the site without annoying color schemes. The site is local, 
I would make it server-side so that others can come in and watch for themselves. The error function is well noticed if you do not enter anything into the search engine."

Kairat Kypchakbaev:
"A cool idea for the final project, and the code is understandable, in case someone wants to rewrite, I'm sure it will be possible to explain by showing the codes very easily. 
In the description, everything is clearly written how to run the code, so there were no problems with this."

You can run our project by using this:

### `npm start`

It will open to view it ib the browser in local host:3000.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You could also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
